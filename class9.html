    ○ In the Von Neumann architecture, the three types of memory commonly mentioned are:<br><br>

    <b>1. Primary Memory (Main Memory or RAM):</b><br>
    ○ This is the memory directly accessible by the CPU for storing and retrieving data that is actively being used or processed.<br>
    ○ It is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off.<br><br>

    <b>2. Cache Memory:</b><br>
    ○ This is a smaller, faster type of volatile memory located closer to the CPU.<br>
    ○ It is used to temporarily hold frequently accessed data and instructions, improving the speed and efficiency of data retrieval.<br><br>

    <b>3. Secondary Memory (Storage):</b><br>
    ○ This refers to non-volatile memory used for long-term storage of data and programs.<br>
    ○ Examples include hard drives, solid-state drives, and other storage devices.<br>
    ○ Unlike primary memory, secondary memory retains data even when the power is off.<br><br>

    ○ These three types of memory work together to provide the necessary storage and retrieval functions required by the Von Neumann architecture for executing programs and processing data.<br>

<!--Start of 1.5 Data Transmission within a computer system-->
              
<div class="question">Q 6. Define Data Transmission and its basic terms within a Computer System? </div>

<div class="answer">

  

    <div class="h"><b>Data Transmission:</b></div>
    Data Transmission means sending data (information) from one place to another.<br>
    In a computer system, this can be between:<br>
    • Two computers<br>
    • A computer and a printer<br>
    • A computer and the internet<br>
    The data can be in the form of text, audio, video, or images.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Basic Terms in Data Transmission:</b></div>

    <div class="h"><b>Bus Architecture:</b></div>
    Bus Architecture is the way data moves inside a computer.<br>
    It refers to a system of wires or pathways (called "buses") that connect the different parts of a computer—like the CPU, memory, and input/output devices—so they can communicate with each other.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Data Paths:</b></div>
    Data Paths are the routes or paths inside a computer where data moves between different parts like the CPU, memory, and input/output devices.<br>
    They include the buses, registers, and circuits that help in carrying and processing data.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Instruction Cycle:</b></div>
    The Instruction Cycle is the process a computer follows to fetch, understand, and carry out one instruction from a program.<br>
    It’s like the computer’s way of thinking and acting step by step.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Interrupts:</b></div>
    Interrupts are signals that tell the CPU to pause what it’s doing and handle something important right away.<br>
    It's like someone tapping you on the shoulder while you're working — you stop for a moment to see what they need.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Parallelism:</b></div>
    Parallelism in computers means doing many tasks at the same time instead of one after another.<br>
    It helps a computer work faster and be more efficient by splitting work into smaller parts that run together.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Simple Example:</b></div>
    Imagine you are folding clothes and your friend is washing dishes.<br>
    Both jobs are being done at the same time — that’s parallelism!<br>

    ii. Assembly Language<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>High Level Languages (HLLs)</b></div>
    High level languages are English-oriented languages and they are commonly used for writing computer programs.<br>
    These languages use English language words such as print, goto, if, end, etc.<br>
    • Therefore, they are easy to learn and use.<br>
    • A program known as compiler/interpreter is required to translate a high level program into machine language.<br>
    • Coding and debugging of a high level language program is much easier than a program written in a low level language.<br>
    • Some examples of high level languages are Visual Basic, C, Java and Pascal.<br><br>

<div class="question">Q 16: Describe the roles of common communication devices like hubs, switches, routers, and gateways in data communication? </div>    
<div class="answer">
  
<img src="./9th/Unit91/combine devices.png" class="more">

<div>
<div class="h"><b>Communication Devices</b></div>
    A device that is used in telecommunication systems for transmitting data from one location to another is known as a communication device.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Commonly Used Communication Devices:</b></div>
    Hub, Switch, Router, and Gateway.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Hub</b></div>
    Hub is a connectivity device used in LAN.<br>
    It connects multiple LAN devices on one network and makes them act together as a single network.<br>
    A hub is a non-intelligent device and sends output to all the devices on the network.<br>
    A hub has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which an input in one port results in it being an output in all the other ports, except the port where it was input.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Switch</b></div>
    Switch is a networking device that performs the same job as hub but is considered more intelligent than hub.<br>
    It gathers information about the data packet and forwards it to only the node (e.g., computer) it was intended for.<br>
    A data packet is a basic unit of communication over a computer network.<br>
    When data is transmitted, it is broken down into packets which are reassembled to the original form once they reach the destination.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Router</b></div>
    Router is a communication device that is used when two or more networks have to be connected for communication.<br>
    They send information from one network to another by selecting the best pathway available.<br>
    There are two types of routers i.e., wired and wireless.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Gateway</b></div>
    Gateway is a device that is used to connect a network to another network that uses different protocols.<br>
    If we have to link different kinds of networks, such as a network of IBM mainframe computers and a network of PCs, we might have to use a gateway.<br>
    Gateways change the format of the data packets but not the contents of the message, to make it conform to the application program of the remote computer.<br>

<div class="question">Q 20: Discuss the advantages and limitations of different network topologies, including bus, star, ring, and mesh. When should each topology be used in a network design? </div>    
<div class="answer">

  

    <div class="h"><b>Network Topology:</b></div>
    Network topologies define the arrangement of various elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network.<br>
    A node represents a computer or a network device.<br>
   
    <div class="h"><b>Types of Network Topologies:</b></div>
    Commonly used topologies are bus, ring, star and mesh.<br>
    
<div class="text">
    <div class="h"><b>1. Bus Topology:</b></div>
    It is the simplest network topology.<br>
    It consists of a single central cable known as bus.<br>
    All the devices are connected to the bus along its length to communicate with each other.<br>
    At each end of bus, a device called terminator is attached so that the signals do not bounce back on the bus causing errors.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Features/Advantages of Bus Topology:</b></div>
    • Suitable for small networks.<br>
    • Easy to add new computers.<br>
    • Requires less cable to implement.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Limitations of Bus Topology:</b></div>
    • If the single cable is damaged at any point, the entire network stops working.<br>
    • Difficult to detect and fix faults.<br>
    • Not suitable for large network.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>When to Use:</b></div>
    Small, temporary networks or environments with a limited number of devices, such as a home or small office network.<br>
</div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="./9th/Unit91/bus topology.png">
    </div>


<div class="text">
    <div class="h"><b>2. Star Topology:</b></div>
    In star topology, all the nodes are connected to central device called switch or hub.<br>
    It is one of the commonly used network topologies.<br>
    A switch can connect 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32 nodes.<br>
    A switch can be connected to another switch to expand the network.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Features/Advantages of Star Topology:</b></div>
    • Easy to connect new device to the network.<br>
    • Easy to detect and fix faults.<br>
    • Failure of one computer does not stop functioning of the entire network.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Limitations of Star Topology:</b></div>
    • Lengthy cable is required for connecting two computers.<br>
    • Costly to implement.<br>

      <img src="./9th/Unit91/star topology.png">
    </div>


<div class="text">
    <div class="h"><b>3. Ring Topology:</b></div>
    The ring network topology is shaped just like a ring.<br>
    It is like a bus with both ends connected together.<br>
    All the messages travel in the same direction.<br>
    Message from one node is sent to the next node.<br>
    Message is received by the intended node, otherwise it is ignored and passed on until the destination is reached.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Features/Advantages of Ring Topology:</b></div>
    • Each node is directly connected to the ring.<br>
    • Easy to install and wire.<br>
    • Data on the network flows in one direction.<br>
    • Not costly to implement.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Limitations of Ring Topology:</b></div>
    • If ring is broken at any point, the entire network stops functioning.<br>
    • Detection of fault is difficult.<br>
    • If any computer in the ring is not working, the whole network is affected.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>When to Use:</b></div>

<div class="question">Q 21: How data is transmitted across a computer network for example circuit switching, packet switching, layering, encapsulation, and protocols? </div>    
<div class="answer">

<div class="text">
    <div class="h"><b>1. Packet Switching (like sending letters)</b></div>
    • Data is broken into small parts called packets.<br>
    • Each packet may take a different path to reach the destination.<br>
    • At the end, the packets are put back together.<br>
    Example: Sending messages on WhatsApp or browsing the internet.<br>
    Best for: Text, pictures, emails.<br>
</div>        
    <div class="image">
      <img src="./9th/Unit91/packet switching.png">
    </div>

<div class="text">
    <div class="h"><b>2. Circuit Switching (like a phone call)</b></div>
    
    • A direct path is made between sender and receiver.<br>
    • That path stays open until the call ends.<br>
    • No one else can use that path during the call.<br>
    Example: Traditional landline phone call.<br>
    Best for: Voice or video calls (real-time communication).<br>
</div>

    <div class="image">
      <img src="./9th/Unit91/circuit switching.png">
    </div>

<div class="text">
    <div class="h"><b>3. Layering</b></div>
    
    • Data travels through layers, like levels in a game.<br>
    • Each layer has its own job (e.g., handling hardware, ensuring correct data, managing connections).<br>
    • Most networks follow the OSI model or TCP/IP model.<br>
    • Helps organize communication and make troubleshooting easier.<br>
 </div>
    
    <div class="image">
      <img src="./9th/Unit91/layering.png">
    </div>

<div class="text">
  <div class="h"><b>4. Encapsulation</b></div>
    • At each layer, extra information (called headers) is added to the data.<br>
    • This helps the receiving device know how to handle and process the data.<br>
    • Like putting a letter in an envelope, then into a bigger envelope with delivery instructions.<br>
</div>
 
    <div class="image">
      <img src="./9th/Unit91/encapsulation.png">
    </div>

  <div>  
    <div class="h"><b>5. Protocols</b></div>
    • Protocols are rules that control how data is sent and received.<br>
    • They ensure proper communication between devices.<br>
    • Examples include HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP.<br>
  </div>

</div>


<div class="question">Q 22: What is the OSI model, and how does it help in understanding the process of data communication? Explain each of the seven layers and their functions.? </div>    
<div class="answer">

    <img src="./9th/Unit91/osi model.png" class="more">
 
  <div>

    <div class="h"><b>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model:</b></div>
    The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is like a step-by-step guide that explains how data moves through a computer network in 7 clear steps or layers.<br>
    It helps different devices and systems communicate with each other, even if they are made by different manufacturers.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>How It Helps:</b></div>
    The OSI model is like a map for data communication — it shows the path, explains each stop, and helps to fix issues when things go wrong.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>The Seven Layers of OSI Model:</b></div>
    The seven layers of OSI model are described below:<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 7 – Application Layer</b></div>
    Application Layer provides services to end-user.<br>
    It interacts with the operating system or application software whenever the user wants to send files, read messages or perform other network related activities.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 6 – Presentation Layer</b></div>
    Presentation Layer takes the data provided by the Application Layer and converts it into a standard format that the other layers can understand.<br>
    At the receiving end it also formats the information so that it looks the way the user can understand.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 5 – Session Layer</b></div>
    Session Layer performs functions that enable two applications or two pieces of the same application to communicate across the network.<br>
    It performs security, name recognition, logging and other similar functions.<br>
    It also establishes, maintains and ends communication with the receiving computer.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 4 – Transport Layer</b></div>
    Transport Layer establishes connections between two computers on the network.<br>
    It handles quality control by making sure that the data received is in the right format and the right order.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 3 – Network Layer</b></div>
    Network Layer decides which physical path-way the data should take to reach the destination.<br>
    The communication device works in network layer.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 2 – Data Link Layer</b></div>
    Data Link Layer defines the format of data on the network.<br>
    This layer converts the data into packets and checks them before putting them on the path-way.<br>
    The communication device Switch works in this layer.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Layer 1 – Physical Layer</b></div>
    Physical Layer defines cables and signaling.<br>
    It provides hardware means such as cables and connectors for sending and receiving data.<br>
    Cables, hubs and repeaters work in this layer.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Practical Example: Sending an Email</b></div>
    Consider sending an email:<br>
    1. Application Layer: The email client application uses SMTP to send the email.<br>
    2. Presentation Layer: The email content is encoded and possibly encrypted.<br>
    3. Session Layer: A session is established between the sender’s email client and the mail server.<br>
    4. Transport Layer: The email data is broken into segments, and TCP ensures reliable delivery.<br>
    5. Network Layer: IP addresses are used to route the email through various networks to the recipient’s mail server.<br>
    6. Data Link Layer: Frames are created for data transfer over the physical network.<br>
    7. Physical Layer: The raw bits are transmitted over physical media such as Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.<br>

<div class="question">Q 24: Explain the evolution of the Internet from its origins to the modern-day global network. What major technologies advancements contributed to its growth? </div>    
<div class="answer">

  <div>

    <div class="h"><b>Internet (International Network):</b></div>
    The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that allows for the exchange of data, information, and communication among users and devices across the world.<br>
    It is a vast and decentralized network that spans continents and connects billions of computers, servers, and other devices.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Evolution of the Internet:</b></div>
    
    <div class="h"><b>1. Early Beginnings (1960s-1980s):</b></div>
    a. <b>ARPANET:</b> The Internet's origins trace back to the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), developed by the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA (now DARPA) in the late 1960s.<br>
    b. <b>Protocol Development:</b> In the 1970s, the development of TCP/IP protocols established the foundation for the modern Internet, allowing different networks to communicate.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>2. Expansion and Standardization (1980s-1990s):</b></div>
    a. <b>Domain Name System (DNS):</b> Developed in 1983, DNS translated human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.<br>
    b. <b>Birth of the World Wide Web:</b> In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>3. Commercialization and Growth (1990s-2000s):</b></div>
    The 1990s saw the emergence of the World Wide Web and web browsers, revolutionizing how people access and share information over the Internet.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>4. Modern Internet (2000s-Present):</b></div>
    The 2000s brought broadband internet and social media platforms, while the 2010s saw the rise of mobile internet and the Internet of Things (IoT).<br>
    In the 2020s, the Internet continues to evolve with cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and 5G technology, impacting nearly every aspect of modern life.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Key Technological Advancements:</b></div>
    Packet Switching, TCP/IP Protocol, DNS, Web Browsers and HTML, Broadband and Wi-Fi, Mobile Networks (4G/5G), Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity.<br>

    <br>

    <div class="h"><b>Working of the Internet:</b></div>
    The Internet is the largest computer network ever built. It globally connects billions of devices and networks.<br>
    It operates through a decentralized architecture using packet switching technology.<br>
    Data is divided into packets, which are routed through a network of interconnected routers and switches.<br>
    Protocols like TCP/IP ensure data is packaged, addressed, and transmitted correctly.<br>
    The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.ncc.gov.pk) into IP addresses.<br>
    Content is hosted on servers, and data is transmitted as packets to and from these servers.<br>
    As data travels through the network, it is encapsulated in headers at each layer of the OSI model (such as the IP and TCP headers).<br>
    When the data reaches its destination, these headers are removed through a process called de-capsulation.<br>
    Security measures like encryption protect data during transmission.<br>
    The Internet's interoperable design allows diverse devices and networks to communicate, making it a global information and communication platform.<br>

<div class="question">SRQ xxi: Briefly explain the significance of data representation in computing , including binary, decimal and hexadecimal systems?</div>   
<div class="answer">
  <div class="h"><b>Data Representation Significance</b></div>
  &#9675; Data representation is crucial in computing as it enables computers to understand and process information.<br>
  &#9675; Understanding how data is represented helps in programming, debugging, and hardware design.<br>
  &#9675; Computers use binary code (0s and 1s) to represent data, which is then translated into decimal or hexadecimal systems for human understanding.<br>

  <div class="h"><b>Bit (Binary Digit)</b></div>
  The smallest unit of memory in a digital computer is a bit, which stands for binary digit 0 or 1.<br>
  Everything in a computer is made from bits.<br>

  <div class="h"><b>Byte</b></div>
  A group of 8 bits is known as one byte.<br>
  It is like a small container that can hold information.<br>
  Bytes are often used to represent things like letters, numbers, or symbols.<br>

  <div class="h"><b>Binary (Base-2)</b></div>
  This uses only 0 and 1.<br>
  Computers use binary because they work with electricity—something is either on (1) or off (0).<br>

  <div class="h"><b>Decimal (Base-10)</b></div>
  This is the number system we use every day (0–9).<br>
  It's easy for people to understand, so we often use it when we work with computers.<br>

  <div class="h"><b>Hexadecimal (Base-16)</b></div>

<div class="question">Q 3: Define Computing Problem and write its types?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <div class="h"><b>1. A Computing Problem</b></div>
    A computing problem is a task or question that requires a solution that can be carried out using a computer.<br>
    It involves taking some input, processing it using a series of steps (algorithm), and producing an output.<br>
    
    <div class="h"><b>Types of Computing Problems</b></div>
    Following are some of the computing problems: -<br>
    1. Decision Problems &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Search Problems &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Counting Problems<br>
    
    <div class="h"><b>1. Decision Problems</b></div>
    (How we can identify problems? Justify with example)<br>
    A decision problem occurs when a given input requires a binary response, either Yes or No. Responses may take various forms, such as true or false.<br>
    
    Examples of simple decision problems:<br>
    ○ The problem whether a given number is odd (or even).<br>
    ○ The problem whether a given number is a prime number.<br>
    
    <div class="h"><b>2. Search Problems</b></div>
    (How we can search problems? Justify with example)<br>
    In science and engineering, many problems are solved using the search. In such types of problems, we have a set of objects among which we search for the solution.<br>
    Example: Finding a path between two cities. Search problems are often represented using graphs, where we have nodes and each link connects to nodes. A node can be connected to multiple nodes.<br>
    To solve such problems, we have three stages:<br>
    ○ Initial State: represents the node from where we need to start search.<br>
    ○ Operations: represents the moves that transition from one node to another.<br>
    ○ Goal: defines the target or end condition.<br>
    
    <div class="h"><b>3. Counting Problems</b></div>
    These problems work on the principle that if an event/decision has A number of choices and another decision/event has B number of choices then total number of possible unique combinations would be A x B.<br>
    
    Counting Problem Example:<br>
    You visit a computer shop to buy a computer system for you.<br>
    The vendor asks you to choose one of 4 monitors, one of 2 keyboards, one of 4 computers and one of 3 printers. How many numbers of possible systems you can choose from?<br>
    <img src="./9th/Unit92/example.png" class="more">
    <div class="h"><b>Solution</b></div>
    You must choose 1 monitor, 1 keyboard, 1 computer and 1 printer.<br>
    For the computer system elements, we have 4 monitors, 2 keyboards, 4 computers and 3 printers.<br>
    Using the counting principle, the number of all possible computer systems that you can buy is given by:<br>
    N = 4 x 2 x 4 x 3 = 96<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 4: Define Problem Solving? What is the major difference in solving simple problems and complex problems? Compare simple and complex problems with one daily life example of each problem.</div>
<div class="answer">
    <div class="h"><b>Problem Solving</b></div>
    Problem solving is the process of analyzing some situation and accordingly behaving to generate some response.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Difference between Simple Problems and Complex Problems</b></div>
    The major difference between solving simple problems and complex problems lies in the level of difficulty and the number of steps required to reach a solution.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Simple Problems</b></div>
    For simple problems the following 4 steps are used:<br>
    ○ Define and analyze a problem: What is the problem and why it is happening.<br>
    ○ Design a plan: What we are going to do (Algorithm).<br>
    ○ Implement the plan: Code it by using some programming language.<br>
    ○ Evaluate: Did our plan work?<br>
    Daily Life Example: Deciding what book to read next from your shelf.<br>
    You look at your available books and choose based on mood or interest.<br>
    The decision has no significant consequences beyond personal enjoyment.<br>

    <div class="h"><b>Complex Problems</b></div>
    However, for complex problems, the 6 step problem solving process could be used:<br>
    ○ Define and analyze a problem.<br>
    ○ Decompose the problem: Make sub-problems that are manageable.<br>
    ○ Identify potential plans for each sub-problem: such as plan A, plan B and plan C.<br>
    ○ Select and design best plan.<br>
    ○ Implement that plan.<br>
    ○ Evaluate.<br>
    Daily Life Example: Balancing a monthly household budget.<br>
    You must consider income, expenses, savings goals, and unexpected costs.<br>
    Each decision impacts your financial stability and requires careful planning.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 5: Before jumping into an action for a problem? What to do first?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <div class="h"><b>Define and Analyze a Problem</b></div>
    Before jumping into an action for a problem, it must be thoroughly investigated to capture all the relevant aspects of the problem.<br>
    For this purpose, we properly define and analyze a problem.<br>
    In defining a problem, there must be clarity and the objectives of the problem must be specified.<br>

<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>1. Decomposition:</b></div>
○ Meaning: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts.<br>
These smaller problems are solved one after another until the bigger complex problem is solved.<br>
These smaller problems are referred as sub problems.<br>
○ In website building, we can divide the work into designing the layout, writing content, coding, and testing.<br>
○ This makes the big job easier to manage and complete step by step.<br>

<div class="h"><b>2. Pattern Recognition:</b></div>
○ Meaning: Finding similarities or patterns in problems or data.<br>
○ While building websites, we notice most pages have headers, footers, navigation bars, and contact forms.<br>
○ Knowing these patterns helps us reuse ideas and design faster.<br>

<div class="h"><b>3. Abstraction:</b></div>
○ Meaning: Focusing on the important information only, and ignoring irrelevant details.<br>
○ While designing a website, we focus on how it looks and works, not on how the browser engine works internally.<br>
○ This helps us avoid distractions and concentrate on what matters.<br>

<div class="h"><b>4. Algorithm Design:</b></div>
○ Meaning: Creating a step-by-step solution or rules to solve a problem.<br>
○ In web development, we might follow steps like: choose a template → add content → style with CSS → test the site → publish.<br>
○ These steps help ensure the website is built correctly and efficiently.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 12: Define Algorithm?</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Algorithm:</b></div>
○ An algorithm is a plan, a set of step-by-step instructions used to solve a problem.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Importance of Techniques:</b></div>
○ Each technique/cornerstone is as important as the others.<br>
○ They are like legs on a table - if one leg is missing, the table will probably collapse.<br>
○ Correctly applying all four techniques will help when programming a computer.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 13: Why Problems are solved through Logical Thinking?</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Logical Thinking:</b></div>
○ Logical thinking refers to analyzing a particular situation or problem using reason and accordingly reaching one or more sensible decisions.<br>
○ The situation analysis requires gathering relevant facts and then deciding the best way based on the reasons.<br>
○ Logical thinking is like building a tower with blocks, where each block (idea) is connected to the one below it (previous idea) in a clear and sturdy way.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Example 1: Everyday Decisions</b></div>
○ Scenario: You want to decide whether to bring an umbrella. The weather forecast predicts a 70% chance of rain.<br>
○ Logical Thinking: Since there is a high probability of rain, it’s reasonable to bring an umbrella to avoid getting wet.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Example 2: Puzzle Solving</b></div>
○ Puzzle: You have a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16. What is the next number?<br>
○ Logical Thinking: The sequence doubles each time. Therefore, the next number is 16 × 2 = 32.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 14: Define Algorithmic Thinking</div>           
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Note:</b></div>
○ By developing algorithmic thinking skills, you can become a better problem solver.<br>
○ Algorithmic thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves:<br>

<div class="h"><b>Techniques of Algorithmic Thinking:</b></div>
○ Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.<br>
○ Identifying patterns and relationships between steps.<br>
○ Developing a clear, step-by-step procedure (algorithm) to solve the problem.<br>
○ Using logical reasoning and decision-making to guide the process.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Example: Find the Largest of Three Unequal Numbers</b></div>

<div class="question">Q 15: Write algorithm of the process part of IPO to find the largest of three unequal numbers?</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Steps to Find the Largest of Three Numbers (A=10, B=20, C=30)</b></div>
○ Step 1: Let three numbers be A = 10, B = 20, and C = 30.<br>
○ Step 2: Check if A is the largest.<br>
○ Step 2.1: If A > B and A > C, then A is the largest.<br>
○ Step 3: If A is largest, then stop the process; otherwise, proceed to the next step.<br>
○ Step 4: Check if B is the largest.<br>
○ Step 5: If B > A and B > C, then B is the largest.<br>
○ Step 6: If B is largest, then stop the process; otherwise, proceed to the next step.<br>
○ Step 7: C is the largest.<br>

The last 7 digits represent the number, and it cannot begin with O. How many different telephone numbers are possible with a given area code?</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Calculation of Different Telephone Numbers:</b></div>
1. The first digit (area code) has no restrictions, so it can be any digit from 0 to 9.<br>
2. The second digit (area code) also has no restrictions, so it can also be any digit from 0 to 9.<br>
3. The third digit (the first digit of the number part) cannot be 0, so there are 9 options (1 to 9).<br>
4. The remaining six digits (the number part) can each be any digit from 0 to 9, so there are 10<sup>6</sup> possible combinations.<br>
Therefore, the total number of possible telephone numbers with a given area code is:<br>

<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>HTML Document Object Model (DOM)</b></div>
&#9675; The Document Object Model (DOM) represents a web document's structure as a tree of nodes that shows how a website is organized.<br>
&#9675; The first node in the DOM is Document node that represents your web page.<br>
&#9675; The "html" node is the root of the tree.<br>
&#9675; All other website parts like pictures, words, and buttons (branches) are child nodes that connect to the "html" node.<br>
&#9675; If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.<br>

        The word is larger in size.<br>
        This is a simple example of the markup language with a few very basic tags. As you can see, the &lt;title&gt; tag is inside the &lt;head&gt; tag. The text, “This text displays the title of the web page” will be the title of the webpage in the header section. The main content of the webpage is what is inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.

<div class="question">Q 11: What is the relationship between HTML and the DOM (How JavaScript is used to modify a website)</div> 
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>HTML and DOM Interaction</b></div>
&#9675; When you write HTML to create a webpage, the browser reads the HTML and turns it into a DOM.<br>
&#9675; The DOM organizes everything in a tree structure, so we can easily change or interact with the different parts using JavaScript.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 12: List out the frequent tags used webpage and what are they used for?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>&lt;html&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;head&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage.<br>
&#9675; Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front end of a webpage.<br>
&#9675; HTML elements used inside the &lt;head&gt; element include title, style, script, link etc.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;title&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; Title tags are used to give title to the browser window.<br>
&#9675; This element is nested inside the &lt;head&gt; section.<br>
&#9675; Title tag is also important for our search engine point of view.<br>
&#9675; We should keep most important keywords inside the title tag.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;body&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; The main part of the HTML is the &lt;body&gt; tag. The &lt;body&gt; tag defines the document's body.<br>
&#9675; The &lt;body&gt; tag contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, tables, etc.<br>
&#9675; The content within the &lt;body&gt; tag is shown on the browser and user can interact with.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Heading Tag</b></div>
&#9675; The &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags are used to define HTML headings tag.<br>
&#9675; &lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading. &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important heading.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Tag for Line Break</b></div>
&#9675; To split a sentence into multiple lines a &lt;br/&gt; tag is used.<br>
&#9675; If this tag is not used between 2 sentences, and even you write the second sentence on a new line; HTML does not recognize this style and will put both the sentences in the same line, one after the other.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 13: List out the frequent tags which are used to Tag the Text?</div> 
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>&lt;p&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; It is used to define a paragraph.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;b&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; It is used to make the text bold.<br>
&#9675; &lt;strong&gt; tag: When you need to emphasize a word but bold.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;small&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; Smaller text size, like footnote.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;i&gt; or &lt;em&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; Italic tags are used to make the text italic like a note.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;sup&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; This tag is used to convert the text to superscript.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;sub&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; This tag is used to convert the text to subscript.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;u&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; Underline tags are used to underline the text.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;center&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; Center tags are used to make the text centered.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;font size=?&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; These tags are used to change the font size. Replace the ? symbol with a number in the range 1 to 7. One is the smallest and seven is the largest font size.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;font color=?&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; These tags are used to change the color of the text that is within the tags. Replace the ? symbol with color such as black, blue, brown, gray, green etc.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;hr&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; Insert a horizontal rule (a horizontal line).<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 14: What is the difference between <span> and <div> tags?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>&lt;span&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline element, which means it does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.<br>
&#9675; It flows with the text around it.<br>
&#9675; It is used for smaller chunks of text.<br>

<div class="h"><b>&lt;div&gt; Tag</b></div>
&#9675; The &lt;div&gt; tag is a block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, stretching out to the left and right as far as it can.<br>
&#9675; It is used for larger sections and layout purposes.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Main Aspects of HTML that can be Changed with JavaScript</b></div>

<b>1. Content:</b><br>
You can change the text inside an element.<br>
document.getElementById("myElement").textContent = "New Text";<br><br>

<b>2. Attributes:</b><br>
You can modify attributes of elements, like src for images, href for links, or custom data attributes.<br>
document.getElementById("myImage").setAttribute("src", "newImage.jpg");<br><br>

<b>3. Styles:</b><br>
JavaScript can modify the styling of HTML elements, including properties like color, font size, background and positioning.<br>
document.getElementById("myElement").style.color = "red";<br>
document.getElementById("myElement").classList.add("newClass");<br><br>

<b>4. Element Properties:</b><br>
JavaScript can change the properties of form inputs, like text fields, checkboxes, etc.<br>
document.getElementById("myInput").value = "New Value";<br><br>

<b>5. Events:</b><br>
JavaScript can add event listener to HTML (e.g., clicks, keypresses) and modify HTML accordingly.<br>
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {<br>
  alert("Button clicked!");<br>
});<br><br>

<b>6. Form Handling:</b><br>

  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission<br>
});<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 27: What aspects of CSS can be changed with JavaScript</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Manipulating CSS Properties with JavaScript</b></div>

<b>1. Inline CSS Styles:</b><br>
You can use JavaScript to manipulate an element’s inline style properties (e.g., color, font-size, width).<br>
document.getElementById("myElement").style.color = "blue";<br>
document.getElementById("myElement").style.fontSize = "20px";<br>
document.getElementById("myElement").style.width = "100px";<br><br>

<b>2. Backgrounds:</b><br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 29: Explain document.write() function in Javascript?</div> 
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>document.write() Function in JavaScript</b></div>
The document.write() function in JavaScript is used to write HTML or text directly into a document (webpage) while the page is being loaded.<br>
It's one of the simplest methods to add content dynamically to a webpage, but it comes with important considerations and limitations.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Syntax</b></div>
document.write('content to be written');<br>

<div class="question">Q 32: Define an Event in Javascript and its some common types?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Events in JavaScript</b></div>
In JavaScript, an event is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, which the browser or the user can sense and trigger (activate) some task to be done, is called an 'event'.<br>
Events can be triggered by user interactions, such as clicking a button, pressing a key, or moving the mouse, as well as by browser-related actions, such as the page loading or resizing.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Common Types of Events</b></div>

<div class="h"><b>Mouse Events</b></div>
click: Triggered when an element is clicked.<br>
dblclick: Triggered when an element is double-clicked.<br>
mousedown: Triggered when a mouse button is pressed down on an element.<br>
mouseup: Triggered when a mouse button is released over an element.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Keyboard Events</b></div>
keydown: Triggered when a key is pressed down.<br>
keyup: Triggered when a key is released.<br>
keypress: Triggered when a key is pressed down and released.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Window Events</b></div>
load: Triggered when the entire page, including all dependent resources, has loaded.<br>
resize: Triggered when the browser window is resized.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Touch Events (for mobile devices)</b></div>
touchstart: Triggered when a touch point is placed on the touch surface.<br>
touchend: Triggered when a touch point is removed from the touch surface.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 33: Define Handling Events with example?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Handling Events with JavaScript</b></div>
To handle events, you typically use event listeners, which are functions that are executed when a specific event occurs.<br>
You can add event listeners to elements using the addEventListener method.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Example: Handling a Click Event</b></div>

&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Button-Click Event&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br><br>

&lt;button id="myButton"&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;<br><br>

&lt;script&gt;<br>
// Select the button element<br>
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');<br><br>

// Define the event listener function<br>
function handleClick() {<br>
  alert('Button was clicked!');<br>
}<br><br>

// Add the event listener to the button<br>
button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br><br>

In this example, when the button with the ID <b>myButton</b> is clicked, the <b>handleClick</b> function is executed, displaying an alert message.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 34: What is the function of prompt() in Javascript?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>JavaScript prompt() Function</b></div>
The prompt() function in JavaScript is used to display a dialog box that prompts the user for input.<br>
It is a simple and effective way to collect input from the user.<br>
The function pauses the execution of the script until the user provides the input or cancels the dialog.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Syntax</b></div>
var userInput = prompt(message);<br>
message (optional): A string that is displayed as the message inside the prompt dialog.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Example</b></div>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
var ip = prompt("Input a number, please.");<br>
document.write("Input from the user was, number=", ip);<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 35: What is the function of alert() in Javascript?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>alert() Method in JavaScript</b></div>
The alert() method displays an alert box with a message and an OK button.<br>
It is commonly used to inform the user about the result of their action or for notifications.<br>
In website development, it is the easiest way to allow some event to occur and respond.<br>
It is mostly used to give a warning message to the users.<br>
The alert dialog box takes the focus and forces the user to read the specified message.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Syntax</b></div>
alert(message);<br>
message: It specifies the text to display in the alert box. It consists of the information that we want to show to the users.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Example 1</b></div>
alert("Hello, world!");<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Example 2: Display Message When Button is Clicked</b></div>
Here, there is an HTML button used for displaying the alert box. We are using the onclick attribute and call the <b>msgSure()</b> function where the alert() is defined.<br><br>

&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
function msgSure() {<br>
    alert("Are You Sure???");<br>
}<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
Do You Mind, CLICKING on the Button -<br>
&lt;input type="button" onclick="msgSure();" value="Be Sure"/&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 36: Define Comments and how are used in javascript?</div> 
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Comments in JavaScript</b></div>
There are two types of comments in JavaScript: single-line comments and multi-line comments.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>1. Single-Line Comments</b></div>
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). Everything following the // on that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the JavaScript engine.<br>
Example: // This is a single-line comment<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>2. Multi-Line Comments</b></div>
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. They can span multiple lines, making them useful for longer explanations or for commenting out blocks of code.<br>
Example: /* This is a multi-line comment.<br>
          It can span multiple lines. */<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 37: Explain different Data Types used in JavaScript?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Data Types in JavaScript</b></div>
There are basically two data types in JavaScript:<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>1. Primitive Data Types</b></div>
Primitive data types represent single values. These are predefined by JavaScript. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.<br><br>

There are following five types of primitive data types in JavaScript:<br>
i. String: represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"<br>
ii. Number: represents numeric values e.g. 100<br>
iii. Boolean: represents boolean value either false or true<br>
iv. Undefined: represents undefined value<br>
v. Null: represents null i.e. no value at all<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>2. Non-Primitive Data Types</b></div>
The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types.<br>
It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.<br><br>

There are following types of non-primitive data types in JavaScript:<br>
i. Object: Objects can have fields with different values and types inside<br>
ii. Array: It can hold more than one value in a single variable<br>
iii. Date: You can use the JavaScript Date object to manipulate the date.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 38: Define variable, write rule for naming variables, how variables are Declaration and initialization (represented) and write Basic Data Types?</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Variables in JavaScript</b></div>
A variable is a temporary container to store information.<br>
A variable is a container (storage area) whose value can be changed during program execution.<br>
The variables are used to represent unknowns.<br>
The basic value that a variable can hold in JavaScript is either a number or set of characters (called string) or a Boolean which is either 'true' or 'false'.<br>
Syntax: var variableName = value;<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>Variable Naming Rules</b></div>
Variable names (identifiers) in JavaScript must follow certain rules:<br>
They can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).<br>
They cannot start with a digit (number).<br>
JavaScript is case-sensitive (reward is different from Reward).<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>How Variables are Declared in JavaScript?</b></div>
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:<br>
1. Automatically (e.g. x = 5;)<br>
2. var:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Declares a variable that can be reassigned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Scope is function-level (hoisted to the top of the function).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Can be redeclared.<br>
3. let:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Declares a variable that can be reassigned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Scope is block-level (only exists within curly braces {}).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cannot be redeclared.<br>
4. const:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Scope is block-level (not hoisted).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cannot be redeclared.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>How Variables are Initialized in JavaScript?</b></div>
The first ever assignment of a value to a variable in the lifespan of program is called 'initialization'.<br>
You can assign a value to a variable using the = operator when you declare it or after the declaration and before accessing it.<br>
Example: Let msg;<br>
msg = "Hello JavaScript";<br>
Note: A good programming practice is to declare and initialize the variable at the same time.<br>

<div class="question">Q 41: Define Operators and explain its typs?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Operators in JavaScript</b></div>
Operators are symbols or keywords that tell a compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical operations and produce a result.<br>
They are used to manipulate data, variables, and values.<br>
Example: let x = 10 + 5;<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>1. Arithmetic Operators</b></div>

<div class="question">Q 42: What is control structure? Explain conditional control structure with examples?</div>  
<div class="answer">
<img src="./9th/Unit93/control structure.png" class="more">
<div class="h"><b>Control Structure in JavaScript</b></div>
In JavaScript, control structures determine the flow of execution of the code. The three basic types of control structures are sequence, selection, and iteration.<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>1. Sequence</b></div>
The sequence control structure is the default mode; instructions are executed one after the other in the order in which they are written.<br>
Syntax:<br>
statement1;<br>
statement2;<br>
statement3;<br><br>

<div class="h"><b>2. Selection (Conditional Statements)</b></div>
Selection control structures allow the code to make decisions, based on conditions.<br>
Types/ scenarios of Control Structures in JavaScript: if, if-else, if...else if...else<br><br>

<b>i. if Statement:</b><br>
If the condition is true then the block of statements following if will be executed.<br>
If the condition is false then the block of statements following if will be skipped and the control will transfer to the next statement if any exists.<br>
Syntax:<br>
if (condition) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Block of statements<br>
}<br>
Example:<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
var kid_age = 5;<br>
if(kid_age > 3) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("&lt;b&gt; Admission Granted !!! &lt;/b&gt;");<br>
}<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
Output: Admission Granted !!!<br><br>

<b>ii. if...else Statement:</b><br>
If the condition is true then the block of statements following if will be executed and the block of statements following else will be skipped.<br>
If the condition is false then the block of statements following if will be skipped and the block of statements following else will be executed.<br>
Syntax:<br>
if (condition) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Block of statements<br>
} else {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Block of statements<br>
}<br>
Example:<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br>
var kid_age = 5;<br>
if(kid_age > 6) {<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;document.write("&lt;b&gt; Age Requirement is not met !!! &lt;/b&gt;");<br>
}<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;<br>
Output: Age Requirement is not met !!!<br><br>

<b>iii. if...else if...else Statement:</b><br>
It is used when there is more than two/multiple conditions to be tested.<br>
If none of the conditions is true then the block of statements following else is executed automatically.<br>
Syntax:<br>
if (condition1) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Block of statements<br>
} else if (condition2) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Block of statements<br>
} ... else {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Block of statements<br>

<div class="question">Q 44: How the sequence of instructions affects the result?</div>  
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Here are some key points on how the sequence of instructions affects the result:</b></div>
<div class="h"><b>1. Order of operations:</b></div>
Changing the order of instructions can alter the order of operations, leading to different results.<br>
<div class="h"><b>2. Dependency on previous steps:</b></div>
Instructions often rely on the results of previous steps. If the sequence is changed, the dependencies may be broken, leading to incorrect results.<br>
<div class="h"><b>3. Error Prevention:</b></div>
Following the correct sequence helps to prevent mistakes, such as attempting to perform actions before necessary conditions are met.<br>
<div class="h"><b>4. Efficiency:</b></div>
A well-ordered sequence can improve the speed and resource usage of the task, making it more efficient.<br>
<div class="h"><b>5. Final Output:</b></div>
Different orders of execution can lead to different results and desired outcomes to incorrect or unexpected ones.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 45: Define Nested Loops in Javascript?</div>
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>A Nested loop:</b></div>
A Nested loop is a loop statement within another loop statement.<br>
Hence, nested loops in Java are also known as ‘loop inside loop.’<br>
There can be multiple loops inside another loop.<br>
<div class="h"><b>Working of Nested Loop:</b></div>
In nested loop, initially the outer loop will start and then the inner loop will run and finish. So, the value of the outer loop will increase, and the inner loop will start and finish again. This will keep happening until the outer loop stops.<br>

<div class="question">Q 49: Define Array?</div>  
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>JavaScript Arrays</b></div>
In JavaScript, An array is a special variable that is used to store more than one value.<br>
These values, called elements, can be of any type (e.g., numbers, strings, objects, other arrays).<br>
Array elements are accessed using their specific position (index), which starts at 0.<br>
Arrays are denoted by square brackets [] and elements are separated by commas.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Syntax:</b></div>
let array_name = [element1, element2, ...];<br>
It is a common practice to declare arrays with the let (var and const are also used) keyword.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Example:</b></div>
let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];<br>

<div class="h"><b>Creating an Empty Array and Adding Elements:</b></div>
let cars = [];<br>
cars[0] = "";<br>
cars[1] = "";<br>
cars[2] = "";<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 50: How to access elements in an array?</div> 
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Syntax:</b></div>
ArrayName[index]  (e.g. Arr[0] for the first element)<br>

<div class="h"><b>Why we use Arrays?</b></div>
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:<br>
let car1 = "Saab";<br>
let car2 = "Volvo";<br>
let car3 = "BMW";<br>
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?<br>
The solution is an array!<br>
An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 51: Write a programme in Javascript  that input via prompt() using for-loop and prints the elements of the array?</div>
<div class="answer">
&lt;html&gt;<br>
&lt;head&gt;<br>
&lt;title&gt;Arrays in JavaScript&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;<br>
&lt;script type=”text/javascript”&gt;<br>
var Arr = [];<br>
for (i=0; i&lt;5; i++)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arr[i] = prompt (“Input Array element”);<br>
document.write(“Elements of Array using For-Loop are, after declaring a null array”, Arr);<br>
&lt;/script&gt;<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;html&gt;<br>
Output:<br>
Elements of Array using For-Loop are, after declaring a null array: 5,3,7,1,9<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 52: Define Functions and its types?</div>  
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Function</b></div>
Function is a block of code that can be executed repeatedly with different inputs.<br>
It is defined once and can be called again and again.<br>
Function can manage a large computer program easily without rewriting the code again.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Types of functions:</b></div>
1. Built-in Functions: Built-in functions in JavaScript are predefined functions provided by the language that perform common tasks e.g prompt(), alert(), etc. Whenever the function is called, the caller does not necessarily need to know the code behind that function to use it.<br>
2. User Defined Functions: It is defined by the user (developer) to solve a particular problem or perform a specific operation.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Syntax of Function in Javascript?</b></div>
Syntax:<br>
function functionName (parameters) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;// code to be executed<br>
}<br>

o function keyword indicates that we're defining a function.<br>
o functionName is defined by the user through which it is identified and called. (e.g., calculateArea, validateInput, etc.)<br>
o parameters are the inputs that the function accepts (e.g., x, y, name, etc.).<br>
o The code inside the curly braces {} is the function body, which is executed when the function is called.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 53: How function is called (Invoked)?</div>
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Calling a Function in JavaScript</b></div>
In JavaScript, a function is called (or invoked) by using the function name followed by parentheses () containing any required arguments.<br>

Syntax:<br>
functionName(argument1, argument2, ...);<br>

o functionName is the name of the function you want to call.<br>
o argument1, argument2, etc. are the values passed to the function.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 54: Write a programme in Javascript  that show function with arguments?</div>                         
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Example: Function with Return Value</b></div>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
function calcBill (bill, amount_rcvd){
    document.write("Your Balance is: ");
    return(amount_rcvd-bill);
}
var balance = calcBill(2345,5000);
document.write(balance);

<div class="question">Q 55: What is meant by Bug, Debugging and Debugger? How do the Pause, Continue, and Step Into options of a debugger help a programmer find and fix errors in a program?</div>  
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Bug:</b></div>
A bug is just a mistake in a computer program.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Debugging:</b></div>
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing mistakes (bugs) in a computer program so that it works correctly and behaves as expected.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Debugger:</b></div>
During debugging, programmers use tools (Debugger) that help them control and observe program execution:<br>

<div class="h"><b>Pause:</b></div>
Temporarily stops the program while it is running.<br>
This allows the programmer to check the current values of variables and understand what the program is doing at that moment.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Continue:</b></div>
Resumes the execution of the program after it has been paused, allowing it to run normally again.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Step Into:</b></div>
Executes the program one line at a time, and if there is a function, it goes inside the function to examine its working in detail.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q 56: Explain Common Types of "Bugs"?</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Common Types of "Bugs"</b></div>

<div class="h"><b>Syntax Errors:</b></div>
Like "grammar" mistakes in coding. If you forget a bracket or misspell a command, the program won't even start.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Runtime Errors:</b></div>
The code starts running but crashes midway (for example, trying to divide a number by zero).<br>

<div class="h"><b>Logic Errors:</b></div>
The trickiest kind. Errors that occur while the program is running and produce wrong results.<br>

<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>&lt;body&gt; Tag in HTML</b></div>
&lt;body&gt; tag: The main part of the HTML document.<br>
- The &lt;body&gt; tag defines the document's body.<br>
- It contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br>
- The content within the &lt;body&gt; tag is shown in the browser and users can interact with it.<br>
- Note: There can only be one &lt;body&gt; element in an HTML document.<br>

<div class="question">SRQ 6: How the event based code is used in JavaScript? </div>  
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Event-based Code in JavaScript</b></div>
Event-based code in JavaScript allows you to execute certain pieces of code in response to events such as user actions (e.g., clicks, key presses) or browser events (e.g., page load). This is central to making interactive web pages.<br>
<div class="h"><b>Event Listeners</b></div>
Event listeners are functions that are called when an event occurs. You can attach event listeners to HTML elements using the addEventListener method.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">SRQ 7: Infer about the External CSS? Where are External CSS generally used?</div>  
<div class="answer">
<div class="h"><b>Inference about External CSS</b></div>
CSS code is stored outside the HTML file<br>
One CSS file can control the design of many web pages<br>
It helps in separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)<br>
Makes web pages consistent, clean, and easy to maintain<br>
Any change in the CSS file updates the design of all linked pages at once<br>

<div class="h"><b>Where External CSS is Generally Used</b></div>
Large websites with multiple web pages<br>
Professional and commercial websites<br>
Educational and institutional websites<br>
Web applications where the same design is reused<br>
Projects where easy maintenance and consistency are required<br>

<div class="question">Q 1: What is difference between Data and Data Analytics?</div>  
<div class="answer">
    <div class="h"><b>Data:</b></div>
    ♦ It is facts, observations or information collected in different forms like numbers, words etc.<br>
    ♦ It can be structured (processed) like tables or unstructured (unprocessed), such as videos or audio.<br>
    ♦ Examples: In a science experiment when you record the temperatures at different times, that temperature values are data.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Data Analytics:</b></div>
    ♦ Data Analytics refers to the process of carefully examining and studying data to identify patterns, draw conclusions, or make the data meaningful.<br>
    ♦ To analyze data, you can use mathematical calculations, statistical techniques, charts, or other tools to understand data.<br>
    ♦ Example: When you record the temperature, after, every hour during a science experiment. You make a graph to see how the temperature changes throughout the day. By looking at the graph, you might notice that the temperature increases as time passed during the day. This information will be the result of your data analysis.<br>
</div>

<div class="question">Q 2: Define Data Science and Explain key concepts/ Components of Data Science?</div>  
<div class="answer">
    <div class="h"><b>Data Science:</b></div>
    Data Science is a subject that combines three main areas: mathematics, statistics, and computer science.<br>
    The main goal of data science is to find useful information from the data we have. This data can be in any form – organized (structured) or messy (unstructured).<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Dataset:</b></div>
    ♦ A dataset is a collection of related data, organized in a structured format, often stored in the form of tables, spreadsheets, or databases.<br>
    ♦ The data is usually organized into rows and columns.<br>
    ♦ Each row is called record/ tuple/ object and each column is called attribute/ identifier/ field.<br>
    ♦ Example: Each student's test scores in a certain class.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Statistics and Probability:</b></div>
    Statistics is the analysis of the frequency of past events and probability is to predict the possibility of future events.<br>
    Data scientists use statistics and probability to find patterns and trends in data.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Mathematics:</b></div>
    Mathematics is a fundamental part of data science. It helps to solve problems and make decisions by simplifying complex data.<br><br>

    <div class="h"><b>Machine Learning:</b></div>

These skills are essential for students in school and later on in life.<br>
They make a big difference when students are applying for jobs and starting their careers.<br>

<div class="h"><b>1. Critical Thinking (Thinking and Problem Solving):</b></div>
Critical thinking means solving problems and asking questions instead of just believing everything you hear or see.<br>

<div class="question">Q17. Define sustainable development, explain sustainable development goals (SDGs), and discuss challenges OR link SDGs with potential problems that need resolving.</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Sustainable Development:</b></div>
Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Examples of Sustainable Development:</b></div>
• Instead of just cutting down trees for wood, plant new trees also.<br>
• Instead of using traditional energy resources, use renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.<br>
• Promoting public transportation and eco-friendly urban planning.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Goals of Sustainable Development:</b></div>
1. No Poverty<br>
2. Zero Hunger<br>
3. Good Health and Well-being<br>
4. Quality Education<br>
5. Gender Equality<br>

7. Affordable and Clean Energy<br>
8. Decent Work and Economic Growth<br>

<div class="h"><b>Sustainable Development Challenges:</b></div>
There are following challenges:<br>

<div class="h"><b>1. War and Instability:</b></div>
When countries conflict or at war, it’s hard to focus on sustainable development.<br>
For example, the war in Ukraine affects things like food sustainability, mainly because Ukraine and Russia produce a lot of wheat and barley, which many countries depend on.<br>

<div class="h"><b>2. Governmental Issues:</b></div>
Not all governments are equally interested in sustainable development.<br>
For example, supporting industries that harm the environment but provide jobs might be a tough choice for some governments.<br>

<div class="h"><b>3. Poverty and Unemployment:</b></div>
Ending poverty is an important goal of sustainable development, but it is not easy.<br>
There are big differences between countries, and even within the same country.<br>
For example, people in cities often have better access to jobs, schools, and healthcare compared to people in villages.<br>
These differences, or inequalities, make it harder to solve poverty for everyone.<br>

<div class="h"><b>4. The Global Economy:</b></div>
When significant financial issues happen worldwide, the poorest people are at risk.<br>
Countries that depend on trade with others may suffer when trade partners face problems.<br>

<div class="h"><b>5. Population Growth:</b></div>
As more people live and grow, we need more resources like water and electricity.<br>
It’s great that more people are doing well, but it’s a challenge to give everyone what they need while protecting the planet.<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q19. What is TAM (Total Addressable Market)? Explain the top-down approach, bottom-up approach, and value theory approach with formulas and examples.</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>Calculation of TAM (Total Addressable Market):</b></div>
TAM is a crucial concept in business and marketing that estimates the overall revenue opportunity available for a product or service.<br>
There are three ways to calculate how big your business market can be:<br>

<div class="h"><b>1. Top-Down Approach:</b></div>
This approach uses existing market reports, industry data, and research to estimate the market size.<br>
<b>Formula:</b> TAM = Total Market Size × Target Segment Percentage<br>
Example:<br>
Total smartphone market size = $1 million<br>
Target segment Percentage for gaming smartphones = 30%<br>
TAM = 1,000,000 × 30% = 300,000<br>

<div class="h"><b>2. Bottom-Up Approach:</b></div>
This method calculates TAM using internal company data, such as sales, pricing, and customer base.<br>
<b>Formula:</b> TAM = Total Number of Potential Customers × Price per Product<br>
Example:<br>
Total Number of Potential Customers = 10,000<br>
Price per product = $200<br>
TAM = 10,000 × 200 = $2,000,000<br>

<div class="h"><b>3. Value Theory Approach:</b></div>
This is based on how much value your product delivers to customers.<br>
<b>Formula:</b> TAM = Total Number of Potential Customers × Value Created Per Customer<br>
Example:<br>
Total Number of Potential Customers = 5,000<br>
Value Created Per Customer = $1,000/year<br>
TAM = 5,000 × 1,000 = 5,000,000<br>

</div>

<div class="question">Q20. What does SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) represent, how is it different from TAM, and include the formula with an example.</div>
<div class="answer">

<div class="h"><b>SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market or Serviceable Available Market):</b></div>
It represents the portion of the Total Addressable Market (TAM) that your business can realistically target, based on factors like geography, product/service offerings, and market reach.<br>
<b>Formula:</b> SAM = TAM × Relevant Market Segment Percentage<br>
Example:<br>
TAM: The global smartphone market is $500 billion.<br>
Relevant Market Segment Percentage: Your Company operates only in North America, where the market is $150 billion.<br>

<div class="h"><b>SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):</b></div>
It represents the portion of the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) that your business can realistically capture within a specific time frame, considering your current resources, competition, and market positioning.<br>
<b>Formula:</b> SOM = SAM × Market Share Percentage<br>
Example:<br>
TAM: Global smartphone market = $500 billion.<br>
SAM: North American smartphone market = $150 billion.<br>
SOM: If your company can realistically capture 5% of the North American market:<br>
SOM = 150 billion × 5% = 7.5 billion<br>
Your SOM is $7.5 billion.<br>

<div class="h"><b>Financial Feasibility:</b></div>
Financial feasibility is a checking that helps us to see if a business idea will make enough money to cover its costs and be successful.<br>
It looks at how much money you need to start, how much it will cost to run, and how much you can earn.<br>

If yes, it’s financially feasible!<br>
